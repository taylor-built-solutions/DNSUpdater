# DNS Updater

## About DNS Updater

This is a program to check the current external/internet facing IP address of the computer it is run on and update DNS settings on Cloudflare as configured in the configuration file.

This project was started from the [cmake conan boilerplate template](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cmake_conan_boilerplate_template) so you may find leftovers from there that I haven't gotten to changing yet.

Ths Boilerplate project will merge new features first, then they will be merged (as appropriate) into cpp_starter_project.
